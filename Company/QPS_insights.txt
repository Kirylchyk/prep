sql:
// returns only those rows that have matching values in *both tables*
// join === inner join

// LEFT JOIN -> return all rows from the left table,
 regardless of whether they have matches in the right table,
  filling in with NULLs where there are no matches.

ML is a subset of AI focused specifically on the idea that machines
can learn from data,
identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention
While AI normally require human intelligence

SAP+Workday
SAP: Might be used for payroll and benefits management, compliance across different countries,
or its integration with other SAP enterprise solutions like ERP for finance and logistics.

Workday: Could be preferred for its user-friendly interface, innovative human capital management features,
analytics, and workforce planning tools.

//Estimation01
Total Slots: 8,000 spaces
Occupancy Rate: 70% are occupied
Average Stay: 5 hours
1 level, 1 entrance, 1 exit

Total Parked Cars = Total Slots × Occupancy Rate = 8,000 × 0.7 = 5,600 cars
Cars Leaving Per Hour= Total Parked Cars / Average Stay = 5,600/5 = 1,120 per hour
Cars Per Second = QPS = Cars per Hour / Seconds in an hour = 1,120 /3,600 = 0.3 cars per sec
(or 1 car in 3 sec)

//Estimation02
Total Slots: 8,000 spaces
Occupancy Rate: 70%
Average Stay: 5 hours
4 levels
2 entrances and 2 exits per level (total of 8 entrances and 8 exits)

Total Parked Cars = Total Slots × Occupancy Rate = 8,000 × 0.7 = 5,600 cars
Cars Leaving Per Hour = Total Parked Cars / Average Stay = 5,600/5 = 1,120 per hour
Cars per Entrance per Hour = Cars Leaving Per Hour / Total Entrances = 1,120 / 8 = 140 per hour per entrance/exit
Cars per Second per Entrance = Cars per Entrance per Hour / Seconds per hour = 140 / 3600 = 0.04
QPS = Cars Per Second = 0.04 * 8 = 0.32
(or 1 car in 3 sec)

In both scenarios, the total QPS across the entire system is roughly the same when calculated over all entrances/exits.
 In the second scenario, each entrance/exit has less pressure because the load is distributed,
  but when summed up, the total QPS across the system doesn't increase.

Scalability, extensibility, and maintainability of system
 - If QPS > 1000, scalability (Load Balancer, Cache (Vertical Scaling) or Sharding (Horizontal Scaling)
-  Extensibility is the ability of a system to accommodate new functionality without significant disruption
 to existing system operations.
 - Maintainability refers to how easily a software system can be maintained over time to correct faults,
 improve performance, or adapt to a changed environment -> replica


Why replication?
- Redundancy and fault tolerance
- downtime
- Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS)
-  Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a formal contract between a service provider and a client -Ю
 For cloud services like AWS, SLAs often cover aspects such as system uptime,
  data availability, and the performance guarantees of the service.
