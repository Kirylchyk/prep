and the matched records from the right table (table2).
 The result is NULL from the right side if there is no match.

SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_id
FROM customers //(left table, table1)
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;

** RIGHT JOIN
-> : Returns all records from the right table (table2),
and the matched records from the left table (table1).
The result is NULL from the left side if there is no match.

SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_id
FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders //(right table, table 2) ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
