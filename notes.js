//In JavaScript, replace(/s/g, "") is a regular expression pattern that
// matches all occurrences of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, line breaks, etc.),
// and g is the global flag that indicates to replace all matches,
// not just the first one. Therefore, replace(/s/g, "") will remove all whitespace characters from the string.
